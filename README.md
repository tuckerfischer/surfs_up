We determined from the Data provided that:
  * The mean temperature does not vary significantly between the two months
  * The min temperature in december is ten degrees lower than the min temperature in June
  * The Temperature in the middle two quartiles only varies by 4-5 percentage points for both months

## Summary

December, as expected, posts lower temperature on average than June however the volitility of the two months is low. Future queries should determine if the differences in temperature is significant and if the difference between the min and max temperatures is noticeable.
